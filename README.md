## Old stuff

WIP: please refer to the following link for code and trained models: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11cucbQUgbyXUzwwl7FxQj5Y4IV_bEX14?usp=sharing

The models are too big to put on git, even when using LFS. We'll be restructuring soon the code and provide a script to download the models.
